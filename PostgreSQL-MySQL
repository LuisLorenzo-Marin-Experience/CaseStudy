Case Study: Heterogeneous Database Integration (PostgreSQL-MySQL) - 2018 Retrospective
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Executive Summary
This study analyzes the technical feasibility of data synchronization between a Libertya ERP system (running on PostgreSQL) and an external MySQL database. The evaluation focuses on using the DBI-Link component and the PL/Perl procedural language as a communication bridge

The Challenge
The objective was to automate a daily data insertion process into the production environment (PostgreSQL) based on complex SELECT queries executed on a remote MySQL host.

Environment Constraints (Circa 2018):
Source: Remote MySQL Host.

Destination: PostgreSQL Server (On-premise/Cloud) running Libertya ERP.

Frequency: Scheduled daily task (Cron-based).

Resource Optimization: Estimated implementation time of ~10 hours.

Proposed Technology Stack
Based on the stability of Linux environments at the time, the following tools were selected:

Database Engine: PostgreSQL.

Procedural Language: PL/Perl (requiring native support within the Postgres binary).

Middleware: DBI-Link. A project leveraging Perl’s DBI drivers to treat remote tables as local schemas.

Access Protocol: SSH for remote administration and secure data tunneling.

Solution Architecture
The technical workflow was broken down into the following implementation phases:

PL/Perl Enablement: Verification of PostgreSQL compilation with the --with-perl flag.

Dependency Installation: Configuring Bundle::DBI and DBD::mysql modules at the OS level.

DBI-Link Configuration:

Creation of a dedicated SCHEMA within the Libertya database.

Mapping credentials and "host coordinates" (IP/Port) for the remote MySQL instance.

Synchronization Logic: Implementation of an INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... routine, scheduled to run as a background service.

Feasibility Analysis (Retrospective)CriterionEvaluationTechnical NoteFeasibilityHighDBI-Link was a mature and well-documented solution in 2018.
SecurityCritical The requirement for SSH access and plain credentials necessitated the use of VPNs or restrictive Firewalls. 
Cost/BenefitExcellent1 00% Open Source solution with no licensing overhead.

Conclusions

The technical proposal was robust by the database integration standards of the era. While modern alternatives like Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) have since become the native standard,
the DBI-Link approach provided total compatibility with specific Libertya ERP versions and environments where Perl was the preferred scripting standard.
