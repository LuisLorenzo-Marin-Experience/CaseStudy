Enterprise Database Migration Case Study: AWS RDS SQL Server to Azure SQL Platform

Executive Summary:

This case study documents the successful migration of a mission-critical SQL Server workload from AWS RDS SQL Server to Microsoft Azure SQL platforms. The project implemented a dual-path strategy, enabling modernization through Azure SQL Database for 
cloud-native workloads and compatibility-driven migration through Azure SQL Managed Instance for legacy systems. The migration improved operational efficiency, security posture, scalability, and governance while ensuring business continuity, performance stability, and compliance alignment. This initiative represents a strategic transformation from infrastructure-managed databases to platform-managed data service

Business Context

This project involved the migration of a production-grade SQL Server workload from Amazon Web Services RDS SQL Server to Microsoft Azure, supporting business-critical applications with strict requirements for:
