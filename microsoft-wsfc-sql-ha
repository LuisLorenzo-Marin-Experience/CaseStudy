Executive Summary:

The organization operates mission-critical workloads on Microsoft platforms using a traditional high-availability architecture based on:

Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition

Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC)

Multi-node failover clustering

Shared storage / clustered storage architecture

Enterprise-grade reliability design

The project focused on extending the existing WSFC architecture by integrating a third cluster node, while ensuring platform stability, reliability, and operational consistency.

Multi-Region WSFC Networking (Microsoft Architecture Perspective)

When extending WSFC across regions or sites, the following Microsoft platform requirements apply:

Required Network Components

TCP/UDP — Cluster service

TCP — RPC

UDP — Cluster Administrator

ICMP

TCP — SMB

Random high UDP ports

Engineering Constraints

Firewall rule complexity

Network security configuration

Latency sensitivity

Throughput limitations

Cluster heartbeat reliability

Network jitter tolerance

Bandwidth availability

Critical Microsoft Design Principle:
Network latency and bandwidth are limiting factors for WSFC stability.

SQL Server Layer Requirements
Mandatory Microsoft Conditions

Node must be a WSFC member

SQL Server Enterprise Edition

Identical patch/software levels

Same SQL Server Service account

Security principal consistency

Configuration symmetry

Version alignment

Feature parity across nodes
