Microsoft SQL Server High Availability Solution
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Executive Summary Case Study
This case study documents as a organization operates mission-critical workloads on Microsoft platforms using a traditional high-availability architecture based on:

Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition
Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC)
Multi-node failover clustering
Shared storage / clustered storage architecture
Enterprise-grade reliability design
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Business Context

The project focused on extending the existing WSFC architecture by integrating a third cluster node, while ensuring platform stability, reliability, and operational consistency.

Engineering Scope
Third WSFC Node Integration
Validation & Readiness Checklist

Cluster Validation
Execute full WSFC validation report
Validate quorum configuration
Confirm cluster membership health
Validate failover scenarios
Compute
Comparable workload handling vs existing nodes
CPU, memory, and IO parity
Performance symmetry
Storage
Sufficient disk space
Identical disk paths
Shared storage compatibility
Failover storage validation
Storage performance parity
Network
Dedicated network adapters
Network traffic separation
HA traffic isolation
Heartbeat network stability
Cluster communication reliability
Multi-Region WSFC Networking (Microsoft Architecture Perspective)

When extending WSFC across regions or sites, the following Microsoft platform requirements apply:

Required Network Components

TCP/UDP — Cluster service
TCP — RPC
UDP — Cluster Administrator
ICMP
TCP — SMB
Random high UDP ports

Constraints
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Firewall rule complexity
Network security configuration
Latency sensitivity
Throughput limitations
Cluster heartbeat reliability
Network jitter tolerance
Bandwidth availability
Critical Microsoft Design Principle:
Network latency and bandwidth are limiting factors for WSFC stability.

SQL Server Layer Requirements
Mandatory Microsoft Conditions

Node must be a WSFC member
SQL Server Enterprise Edition
Identical patch/software levels
Same SQL Server Service account
Security principal consistency
Configuration symmetry
Version alignment
Feature parity across nodes

Disaster Recovery (DR) Readiness — Microsoft Model
DR Engineering Requirements

Formal DR documentation
Recovery procedures
Failover workflows
Recovery validation steps
Operational runbooks
RPO/RTO definitions
Communication protocols
Test execution planning

Governance model
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Compliance documentation

The project explicitly identified the need for formal DR documentation and structured DR testing governance.
