Executive Summary Case Study: AWS RDS SQL Server High Availability & Disaster Recovery Architecture
___________________________________________________________________________________________________


## Context

The organization operates mission-critical production databases using Amazon Web Services managed services, specifically:

* AWS RDS for SQL Server
* Managed High Availability configurations
* Multi-AZ deployments
* Zone-level fault tolerance
* Cloud-native resilience engineering
* Managed platform operations

The project focused on validating, documenting, and governing a **cloud-native HA/DR strategy** using managed database services instead of infrastructure-managed clustering models.

---

## Engineering Scope

### High Availability Configuration (Multi-AZ)

#### Platform Capabilities

* Synchronous replication
* Automatic failover
* Zone-level redundancy
* Managed infrastructure
* Service-level HA
* SLA-driven availability model

**Engineering Focus:**

* Eliminate infrastructure-level clustering
* Use platform-managed HA

---

### Region Strategy & Governance

#### Engineering Considerations

* Ability to select specific AWS regions
* Regional service availability
* Latency considerations
* Compliance requirements
* Data residency governance
* Cost modeling
* DR region alignment
* Network topology design

**Key design principle:**
Region selection is a governance decision, not just a technical one.
