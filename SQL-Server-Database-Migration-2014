Migration from SQL Server 2005 to SQL Server 2014 (Single Instance)

Executive Case Study Summary

This case study documents the modernization of a legacy SQL Server 2005 single-instance environment to SQL Server 2014. The project addressed critical risks related to licensing compliance, platform obsolescence, scalability limitations, 
and operational sustainability. The migration strategy combined technical modernization with organizational enablement through training, consulting, and infrastructure modernization. The result was a secure, scalable, compliant, and supportable 
database platform aligned with modern enterprise standards.

Business Context

The organization is currently operating on a legacy SQL Server 2005 environment with outdated licensing and infrastructure, supporting a growing user base and increasing operational demands.

Current Licensing Inventory
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 User CAL License
Product: SQL CAL 2005 English Open No Level User CAL
Version: 2005
Quantity: 20 CALs
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition
Platform: Win32
Language: English
Version: 2005
Quantity: 1 Server License

This licensing model is technically and operationally misaligned with the current usage profile.

Current Usage Scenario

User Connectivity Profile
Average number of connected users: ~450 users
Current CAL model: 20 User CALs
Resulting gap:
Licensing misalignment
Compliance risk
Scalability limitations
Performance and concurrency risks
